How good we are :
A little boy went into a drug store, reached for a soda carton and pulled it over to
the telephone. He climbed onto the carton so that he could reach the buttons on the
phone and proceeded to punch in seven digits.
The store-owner observed and listened to the conversation: The boy asked, "Lady,
Can you give me the job of cutting your lawn? The woman replied, "I already have
someone to cut my lawn."
"Lady, I will cut your lawn for half the price of the person who cuts your lawn now."
replied boy. The woman responded that she was very satisfied with the person who
was presently cutting her lawn.
The little boy found more perseverance and offered, "Lady, I'll even sweep your
curb and your sidewalk, so on Sunday you will have the prettiest lawn in all of Palm
beach, Florida." Again the woman answered in the negative.
With a smile on his face, the little boy replaced the receiver. The store-owner, who
was listening to all, walked over to the boy and said,
"Son... I like your attitude; I like that positive spirit and would like to offer you a
job."
The little boy replied, "No thanks, I was just checking my performance with the job
I already have. I am the one who is working for that lady, I was talking to!"
